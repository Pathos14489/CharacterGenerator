# Character Generator Prototype

Uses character cards and lorebooks(which are just character_cards with extra steps) to make a chromadb vector database and then uses that as RAG for generating characters using a custom OpenAI server with GNBF grammar support. Will likely need tweaks to work with a different API that doesn't offer than, so really more of a demo than anything.

Super basic, only posting it to share with someone lol
